## Integrating Spark Router

LangBot supports integrating with locally deployed Spark Router and third-party Spark Router services built using Spark Router.

### Usage

1.  Obtain an API key from Spark Router

        If Spark Router is deployed locally, please configure the API address yourself (refer to [Container Network Connection](https://docs.langbot.app/en/workshop/network-details.html)). If using a third-party Spark Router service, you can copy the address from the page. Note that `/v1` needs to be appended to the address.

2.  Add a model in LangBot, select Spark Router as the provider, and fill in the corresponding API key and API address
